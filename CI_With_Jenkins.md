# CI with Jenkins

- What is SDLC – software development lifecycle
- Development – testing - release.
- Historically has been very slow.
- Preventing us from using ideas. Took too long to release.
- Our job as DeVops engineers is to modernise things
- We integrate automation
- Using JENKINS AWS, We speed up this process
- CI/CD – continuous integrations, delivery, deployment
- Everyday developers are committing their code to get reviewed.
- Delivery – using automation to test the code
- Deployment – making the project live
